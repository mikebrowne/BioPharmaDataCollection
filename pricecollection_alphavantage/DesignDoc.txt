SUMMARY
-------
AlphaVantage offers free stock pricing data for public companies. Since it would be a waste of time to download
data every time I need to run a program, it seems to make more sense to build a wrapper for saving, loading and
collecting the data.

NOTES

June 22, 2019
After trying to run the script I noticed that it would only collect for a few of the companies.
Looking into it, there is a minute and daily API call limit for non-premium API keys.

The limit is 5 per minute and 500 per day.

So it is possible to get all of the data for 200 stocks, but will need to build in a timer to pause between each
set of 5. Further, if the watchlist is larger than 500, then it will take multiple days to get all of the data.
Because of this I will need to build out a way to load the data currently on file, find the tickers not currently
collected and finally collect those.

Steps:
1. Build out the 60+ second pause [x]
2. Build functionality to create the csv file if it does not already exist [x]
3. Build the data load function [x]
4. Build the function to get the left over tickers [x]
