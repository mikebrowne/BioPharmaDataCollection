TO DO LIST
----------

June 18, 2019
    * Refactor the code in businesswirescraper.py
        * The project was haphazardly put together to get a running program. It should be refactored so it can
        be made more flexible. Note there are also likely redundant steps so should be able to make the code run faster.
        * Would like the code to eventually be a class instead of a function

    * Move over the clinicaltrialscraper functionality to this folder

    * Change the code in businesswirescraper.py such that the data saves into an SQL file instead of as a CSV
